# Release Notes Flyt CMS 7.9.6

## Index name of user for UserAttribute.

## Re-introduce *aksess:smoketest*
Running aksess:smoketest starts a instance of the application and loads all display templates, failing the build if 
any pages return HTTP 500.

## Value from popup not inserted into field (AP-2030)
Most fields in admin have onBlur="openaksess.editcontext.blurField()", but when opening a modal 
openaksess.editcontext.focusField is first set to the new field, then blurField() is run. 
The result of this is that when returning from the modal the chosen value is not inserted into the field.
